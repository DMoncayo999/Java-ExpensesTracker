# Overview

Welcome! This time using Java languaje, Visual Studio Code and GitHub we are going to create a program that helps users tracks their daily expenses. 

You can find a video demo for this program in the link below:

# Future Work

In the future, I would like to improve this basic expenses tracker:

- Integrating additional functionalities, such as sorting expenses by date or amount, filtering expenses based on criteria, and allowing users to export reports in different formats (PDF, Excel, etc.).
- Adding  a structured data format (like CSV or JSON) for file storage to facilitate easier data manipulation and compatibility with other tools or applications.
- Implementing more informative error messages for users when invalid inputs are detected, guiding them on how to correct their input.
